![RYTE Demo](demo.gif)

Writing meaningful commit messages shouldn't feel like extra work. But in fast-paced teams, it often does. 

**RYTE** is your AI-powered CLI companion that **bridges** the gap between "coding" and "documenting". It reads your git diffs, understands the context of your changes, and generates professional, semantic-compliant messages in seconds.

### Core Value
- **Stay in Flow**: No context switching. Pure terminal workflow.
- **Structured by Default**: Clean Conventional Commits automatically.
- **Context-Aware**: Understands diffs and branch intent.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Accept, edit, or regenerate — your call.

## ⚡ Quick Start

> ⚡ **TL;DR**: `git add .` → `ryte c` → **done.**

```bash
# 1. Install globally
npm install -g @riflo/ryte

# 2. Set your free AI key (get one at console.groq.com)
# Mac/Linux:
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."
# Windows (PowerShell):
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."

# 3. Stage your changes and go
git add .
ryte c
```

## The Problem It Solves

Your git log shouldn't look like this:
```bash
❌  update auth
❌  fix bug
❌  changes
❌  wip
```

With `ryte c`, it looks like this:
```bash
✅  feat(auth): implement JWT refresh token rotation
✅  fix(cart): resolve crash on empty product array
✅  refactor(db): extract query builder to repository layer
✅  chore: update dependencies to remove security vulnerabilities
```

### See the Magic

**What RYTE sees (`git diff --staged`):**
```diff
+ const refreshToken = generateToken(user.id)
+ await saveTokenToDB(refreshToken)
+ return res.cookie('refresh_token', refreshToken, { httpOnly: true })
```

**What RYTE writes:**
> `feat(auth): implement JWT refresh token rotation via HTTP-only cookies`

One command. Same diff. Clean history.

## 🧑‍💻 Built for Developers Who Care

If your git history looks like:
- `fix`
- `update`
- `asdf`
- `final-final-real`

**RYTE is for you.**

---

## Installation

### Via NPM (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @riflo/ryte
```

### Via PNPM / Yarn
```bash
pnpm add -g @riflo/ryte
# or
yarn global add @riflo/ryte
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Generate Semantic Commit
Stage your files first, then let AI write the message.
```bash
git add .
ryte c
```
**Interactive Workflow:**
- `[A]ccept`: Applies the commit immediately.
- `[E]dit`: Opens your default editor (Vim/Notepad/Nano) to refine the message.
- `[R]egenerate`: Ask AI for another suggestion.
- `[C]ancel`: Abort the process.

### 2. Generate PR Draft
Summarize your entire branch history into a clean Markdown description.
```bash
ryte pr
```
**Example Output:**
```markdown
# 🔥 Feat: User Authentication Flow

## 📋 Summary
Introduces a complete JWT-based authentication system, including login, registration, and automatic token refresh via HTTP-only cookies.

## 🚀 Key Changes
- Implement `AuthMiddleware` for route protection
- Add `RefreshTokenRepository` for token rotation
- Create `LoginScreen` and `RegisterScreen` UI components

## ⚠️ Important Notes/Impact
- **Requires DB Migration**: Run `php artisan migrate` for the new `personal_access_tokens` table.
- **Dependency Added**: Added `firebase/php-jwt` package.

## 🔍 Reviewer Checklist
- [ ] Logic health & edge cases
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Code style & standard conformity
```

## How It Works

1. **Extraction**: Runs `git diff --staged` to capture your latest changes.
2. **Analysis**: Filters out lockfiles and noise, then sends the core diff to high-performance AI models (Groq Llama 3 or OpenAI GPT-4o-mini).
3. **Generation**: Crafts a semantic message (feat, fix, chore, etc.) based on the actual logic changes.
4. **Interaction**: Presents a TUI (Terminal UI) for you to review and finalize the entry.

The result? **AI assistance without surrendering control.**

## Why Not Just Use GitHub Copilot?

Fair question. Here's an honest comparison:

| Feature | GitHub Copilot | **RYTE** |
|---|---|---|
| Works natively in terminal | ❌ | ✅ |
| Diff-aware (reads what you actually changed) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Enforces Conventional Commits format | ❌ | ✅ |
| Works with any editor | ❌ | ✅ |
| No IDE required | ❌ | ✅ |
| Free tier available | ❌ | ✅ (via Groq) |
| BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) | ❌ | ✅ |

*Copilot helps you write code.*  
**RYTE helps your future self understand it.**

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

We understand that sending code to an external API is a sensitive decision. Here's exactly what RYTE does and does *not* do:

| What we send | What we do NOT send |
|---|---|
| `git diff --staged` output only | Full file contents |
| Truncated to max ~16k chars | Binary files |
| Nothing from untracked files | `.env` or secret files |

- ✅ No data is stored or logged by RYTE itself.
- ✅ Lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`) are auto-excluded.
- ✅ Minified files (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`) are auto-excluded.
- ✅ You can use your own API key (BYOK) for complete control over data flow.
- ✅ Supports local AI models via Ollama (on roadmap).

## Configuration

**RYTE** requires an API key to function. We support high-performance LLM providers like Groq and OpenAI.

### Groq (Recommended - Free & Instant)
Get your free key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys).
```powershell
# Windows
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."

# Linux / Mac / Git Bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."
```

### OpenAI 
Get your key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

> [!TIP]
> Add these to your system environment variables to avoid setting them in every new session.

## Philosophy

We believe that **every commit should be written right**. A clean git history is not just about aesthetics; it's about debuggability, revertability, and understanding the "why" behind the code months after it was written.

*Your future self will thank you.*

---

## ⭐ Why Developers Love It

- **No more “wip” commits**: No more generic, lazy history.
- **Cleaner PR reviews**: Reviewers understand the *why* instantly.
- **Better team collaboration**: Professional communication by default.
- **Future-proof project history**: Debug and revert with confidence.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] **GitHub Action**: Automate commit linting and PR generation in CI/CD.
- [ ] **Custom Rulesets**: Define your own organization-specific commit styles.
- [ ] **Ticket Integration**: Automatic JIRA / Linear / GitHub Issues syncing.
- [ ] **Local LLM Support**: Support for Ollama/Llama.cpp for offline-only environments.
- [ ] **Context-Aware Radius**: Analyze importing files to suggest impact warnings.

## FAQ

**Q: Does it send my whole code to the AI?**  
A: No. It only sends the `git diff` of your staged changes. It automatically ignores binary files and common lockfiles.

**Q: Is it free?**  
A: The tool itself is free. If you use Groq, the API usage is currently free. If you use OpenAI, you pay for what you use (extremely cheap, ~$0.01 for dozens of commits).

**Q: Can I use this in a private company repository?**  
A: **Yes.** RYTE only sends the staged diff to your configured AI provider using your own API key (BYOK). No code or credentials are ever stored by RYTE itself.
